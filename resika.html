<h2 class="subtitle">For your viewing pleasure.</h2>

<p>First of all I‚Äôm very excited for this game! Crafting and gathering seem to be a large part of the game, and that is MY JAM. I played in the Preview for over 75 hours, and I‚Äôm up to about 190 hours now. A vast majority of that time was messing around with the gathering and crafting, poking the mission boards, and questing. A small amount of time was idling while poking around at stats and data to see what was broken or not working correct, and gathering info to make guides (or at least get them started and add live values later.) I did not participate in PVP, as PVP is not my main goal or one of the things I particularly enjoy - I do look forward to eventually playing with the invasions and the wars, I didn‚Äôt level up enough to do so in this Beta, however.</p>
<p>That being said, here is a list of some of the QoL changes or implementations I feel would vastly improve the game, as well as some other observations in general.</p>
<h2 id="character-creation">Character Creation</h2>
<p>This is the first thing you do when starting the game. This is your absolute first chance to grab your player‚Äôs interest, beyond the advertisements and flashy splash images on your website. In the Preview, I was wholly underwhelmed, but passed it off bc it was still an alpha/preview state. Now a year later we get to beta state, and while there has been some improvements, it‚Äôs still subpar, especially knowing the kind of customization games are capable of these days.</p>
<p>One of the big things for me was the face models - all the women looked exactly like the men, save for maybe 2 face models. I switched back and forth on a few of the faces from male to female, and they were literally the same except for the tiniest softening of a jawline and a slight change in the eyeshape and a tiny bit of some pseudo-eyeliner. I did not get screenshots but I‚Äôm sure you can access this quite easily.</p>
<p>The other thing was again the lack of customization of the faces. They are set premades, and most have very defining features - eyeshape, nose size and shape, lip sizes, bone structure. There is a bit of cultural diversity, but (in my opinion to my personal aesthetic taste), there was only 1 that was close to my ideal (the female face on the far bottom left.) A close second was the female face on the left 2 spots above the bottom. However among the other faces, there were features I liked, but I would have loved to mix and match them. Jawline from this one, brow/cheeks from this one, eyes from that one. With ONLY Premade Faces, everyone is going to look the same save for hairstyle/color, eye color, and tattoos/scars - which while that adds a little bit of diversity, they are still all the same small pool of faces with different coats of paint.</p>
<p>Perhaps some sort of slider in the character creator, to alter size and shape. And if not that, then have a selection of noses, eye shapes, lip shapes for each face - so we can pick the overall bone structure/jawline/outline of the face, and then customize the details to match what we want our character to look like.</p>
<p>There is no ‚Äúfix this later‚Äù option, we get warned about this on creation, so being able to fine tune our character is explicitly important.</p>
<p>I feel that the selection of hair and eye colors is fine - some people are going to yell about the neon pink hair, but it‚Äôs a magical world, maybe the magic storm that beached us changed our hair color <span class="emoji" data-emoji="stuck_out_tongue">üòõ</span> I also like the scars and freckles, perhaps having a slider for size and placement would allow a little further customization.</p>
<p>On the topic of hair colors - please for the love of god, allow us to change the brow colors when we change the hair style. We can add facial hair on women and change it‚Äôs color, but we can‚Äôt change the eyebrow color? I have bright blonde or bright red hair and black eyebrows. Please no.</p>
<h2 id="user-interface">User Interface</h2>
<p>The user interface is the second mechanic to grab and immerse your player. If it‚Äôs clunky, we get frustrated, and may stop playing. Overall I think the UI is okay, but it needs a few tweaks.</p>
<p>First, I think you need to change the default keybind for dodge to something other than Shift. Myself and quite a few other people had to change to something else (most used Tab), because Windows kept asking if we wanted to enable Sticky Keys. That is a problem lol.</p>
<p>When you put up a server wide announcement it put a bar at the bottom of the screen - this actually blocked the bottom part of the attributes window, and I found it difficult to hover over my exp bar to see the status of my exp numbers or to click on the ‚Äúview level rewards‚Äù button. I had to hunt around on the left and right of the message box to find a part of the exp bar I could hover over to see my numbers to level. Perhaps move that announcement bar to the top, above the compass.</p>
<p>Customization: allow us to change or customize the size or placement of the HUD elements. Particularly the chat box (both in small and expanded form).</p>
<h2 id="on-the-topic-of-the-chatbox">On the topic of the chatbox:</h2>
<p>The chat box is okay but needs some tweaking - trying to identify who said what is hard as their name is TINY compared to their message, and comes AFTER what they said. The standard formula of ( [timestamp]CharacterName: Message here ) works just fine (the timestamp being an optional toggle in the settings).</p>
<p>Please let us resize the chatbox. It takes up a pretty large section in the bottom left, and for streamers, that is a problem especially. We generally hide the chat on streams, to protect both the people speaking in game, and our viewers from seeing any chat that is rude, etc. That takes a lot of our streaming real estate. We also CANNOT hide the chat box while it is expanded (while typing a message, or having hit just ESC) - it takes up a whole 1/3 of our screen and that is just not feasible to hide on a stream. Even for non-streamers, let us have an option to lock/unlock the chat box, and drag up the top if we want a long feed to read at any point. It‚Äôs huge and clunky and unnecessary. PLEASE revise this or give us an option to change it to suit our needs.</p>
<p>We need a local /say option. Right now the only two that are even remotely close are the AREA and GLOBAL chats - which is unhelpful when we just want to say a hello to a group of people we passed in the forest, or have a conversation with a local group in a town, or even roleplay in the immediate vicinity. I don‚Äôt need to announce my greeting to the two people I just passed to the entire global chat. Even just a simple ‚Äúthank you‚Äù or ‚Äúyou‚Äôre welcome‚Äù is cumbersome, bc the only way to do so without it going into (and getting lost in) the general or area chats is to target them with your reticle and hit H, and choose to whisper them. So many steps and SO CLUNKY. I‚Äôd rather just be able to type /s or /say or even /local, and say ‚Äúhey thanks Character1346 for the assist‚Äù The range for said chat could encompass roughly the size of a settlement.</p>
<p>Related: Roleplay commands. Other games have a custom command that prints out custom text as an emote. /emote swoons at the handsome gentleman - would print ‚ÄúResika swoons at the handsome gentleman‚Äù in a custom color, and are generally only broadcast to the local vicinity, not an entire zone or global. It is something that helps enrich in game roleplay and allows for some creative ways to communicate. It helps fill the gap for that the physical emote actions don‚Äôt or can‚Äôt cover.</p>
<p>Chat tabs. We need a way to separate chat channels. Right now they all bleed into each other. No amount of filtering or muting will fix that, especially if we want to see or monitor all the chats, just not in one stream. Being able to set up custom tabs is a must. This is pretty much standard in most MMO‚Äôs these days. I‚Äôd love to be able to have the general/help chats in one, area in another, company and faction in another, and whispers in a last one. I‚Äôd probably have emotes and say enabled in all, but being able to sort them out in chunks like this (or whatever works for folks, this is my way), would make monitoring chat much better, and easier to handle. I don‚Äôt even look at chat right now, it‚Äôs just too much too fast all the time gogogogogo, and I don‚Äôt think ‚Äújust mute or disable a channel‚Äù is the solution to that.</p>
<h2 id="attributes-panel">Attributes Panel</h2>
<p>The attributes panel is fine as it is, however some display issues need to be addressed.</p>
<p>There are multiple threads about this but linking gathering stats to the core combat stats is a bad move. It makes people feel forced to stack a stat that‚Äôs worthless to their combat weapon so they can get the perks linked to the stats. Instead of linking it to combat stats, link the bonuses to certain tradeskill levels. Or create a gathering skill tree that we get points from leveling our character and can spend in this gathering tree to get the perks, same as weapon skills. Im a bow and rapier girl, but if I love fishing I want focus, which is useless to me, just to get fishing bonuses? What is that. Very Feelsbadman.</p>
<p>What do the attributes actually DO. I can see the icons for weapons and assume that the stat is good for that weapon. But for weapons that show up twice, which stat is stronger for it? Are they equal? Do attributes just convert to weapon and ability damage for their matching weapons? Does it add anything else like critical hit or chance, or damage reduction. The basic understanding is kind of there, but we need more details as to which stat does what for which weapon in the case of dual stats. And if they have any other hidden bonuses.</p>
<p>What the heck is Luck? Luck is mentioned both by a % and a point value. It can‚Äôt be both. Please pick one. Or, have Luck in the attributes tab and let us see in a tooltip, or some other ui explanation, how many points translate into %. There is both gathering luck and luck for mobs/chests, and that needs to be explained as well, unless they are the same system.</p>
<p>Buffs need to be displayed SOMEWHERE. I have to manually go through my gear and calculate how much luck, how much gather speed, etc, and also manually go through to see what perks are active at any given time from gear. If I eat luck food, that doesn‚Äôt show ANYWHERE other than the food buff, but the luck stat doesn‚Äôt show up anywhere telling me how much I have stacked. This is not good. Perhaps put them in the attributes panel underneath where the weapon damage/mana etc is displayed, and it can change depending on what gear we have on and what perks are active.</p>
<p>Some sort of UI popup or alert about what food buffs and potion buffs stack/don‚Äôt stack. From testing it seemed I could get a tradeskill and basic health regen food stacked, didn‚Äôt try stat food as I couldn‚Äôt craft it (didn‚Äôt find any salt or sugar until the last day). Wasting a hard earned, self crafted or expensive potion bc I didn‚Äôt realize it didn‚Äôt stack with the booster I had - which was unrelated in stats - was not fun. I want to have my gather booster on, and also use a potion with a short time effect if I get into combat, and keep my booster. It‚Äôs a bit of a waste the way it is now.</p>
<h2 id="gathering">Gathering</h2>
<p>Drop rates of mats NEEDS to be reviewed. Having to use a starmetal pick and luck food and luck gear just to get the lowest tier of green-rarity mats to make low level gear is very, very backwards. I think you swapped some 1s and 0s in your code for certain items. Fae Iron and Petrified wood seemed to be the big ones, I think there is a cloth and leather equivalent as well.</p>
<p>Quantity rates needs some looking at. I have like 3000 hyssop and nowhere to use it. It‚Äôs only used for weak health potions. I get SO MUCH of it while hunting for spices (also a problem of it‚Äôs own) that I have to drop it, and it‚Äôs flooding the market bc everyone else gathering is having the same issue. Either drop the quantity of hyssop on gather, or put hyssop in other recipes. Perhaps make hyssop and water the statics for potions, and sub the reeds or thorny vines which currently have no use to be the medicinal mat needed for weak health potions.</p>
<h2 id="general">General</h2>
<p>The Town Recall is too long. One hour? I max out my inventory in half that time, and have to either run to a shrine to teleport, kill myself to deathmarch back to town, or just run back to town. Lower the cooldown to 30m and it will fit much nicer. It will also reduce the strain of dealing with using Azoth to fast travel AND craft, and will open up crafting a bit more in the use of azoth.</p>
<p>Unsure if intended but you can use other people‚Äôs campfires as your own recall point if they already placed it, meaning if you find one in the wild you have no need to make your own. Might want to adjust that.</p>
<p>Glamor system. There are multiple threads about this. We need one that lets us collect dyes and skins from everywhere, not just the store. think like GW2 style.</p>
<p>Guild Hall and Guild Storage. There are also multiple threads on this. This is absolutely needed, especially if you want to foster Company play and all these group projects. Personal and Town Storage alone is not enough for someone to stock supplies to craft for their company. We have no ways to funnel supplies to our crafters. No mail system or communal bank for our Company. We NEED that. A guild hall would be a fun idea to expand housing for guilds, perhaps for the controlling guild or something?</p>
<p>Build Slots - for gear, attributes, and weapon skills. Being able to switch from gathering to combat is kind of important for a game that boasts the ability to do all the things. Right now it is very clunky to go into the inventory and one by one switch out gear, especially if we have a set for each gathering tradeskill which is a must for the luck buffs and particular perks. I‚Äôm sure there is a way to put this in the game that doesnt detract or mess up combat or pvp.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm out of time but i covered quite a lot of stuff that wasn‚Äôt particularly bug related.</p>
<p>Thank you for making this game!</p>
