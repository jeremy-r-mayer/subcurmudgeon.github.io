## Equipment
- Stand Mixer
- Baking Sheet
- Parchment Paper
- Oven-Safe Pan
- Cooling Rack

## Ingredients
- 2 1/4 cups `Warm Water`
- 2 tablespoons `Sugar`
- 1 tablespoon `Active Dry Yeast`
- 1 tablespoon `Salt`
- 2 tablespoons `Olive Oil` or `Avocado Oil`
- 6 cups `All-Purpose Flour`
- Several `Ice Cubes`

***

## Directions
1. In the bowl of a stand mixer combine the `water`, `sugar` and `yeast`. Allow to sit for 5 minutes or until the `yeast` begins to foam.
2. Add the `salt`, `oil`, and `all-purpose flour` to the mixer bowl. Using a dough hook attachment, mix slowly until combined, then increase to medium speed and knead until dough is smooth and pulls away from the bowl. Remove the dough, clean and oil the bowl, then return the dough to the bowl and cover with a towel for 1 hour or until the dough has doubled in size.
3. Remove dough from bowl and divide in half. Pat each piece of dough into a thick rectangle. Roll the dough starting from the long edge and pinch the ends to seal. Arrange the loaves side-by-side and seam-side down on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Slash the tops of each loaf and cover with a clean towel. Allow to rise for 1 additional hour.
4. Place an oven rack in the middle position and another in the lowest position. Preheat to 375 degrees F.
5. When the oven is ready, place the over-safe pan filled with `ice cubes` on the lower rack and parchment-lined baking sheet with bread loaves on the middle rack. Close the oven door quickly.
6. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes with convection setting enabled, rotating the baking sheet halfway through, then place on a cooling rack.
